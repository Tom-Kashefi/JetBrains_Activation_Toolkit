## About This Project

This repository is a **research and learning project** designed to help students and developers understand:

- JetBrains IDE configuration (e.g., VM options, plugins)
- Script automation for lab environment setups
- Network filtering concepts using tools like `ja-netfilter` (in educational context)

It includes setup scripts and configuration files compatible with JetBrains versions 2017â€“2022.3.3 on Windows and macOS.  
**This project is not for illegal activation and does not include any license bypass methods.**

## Why This Matters

Modern JetBrains IDEs (IntelliJ IDEA, PyCharm, WebStorm, etc.) offer complex configurations for extensions, plugins, and environment management.  
This toolkit is created for students and researchers who want to explore how these systems work in a **controlled, legal, and educational environment.**

This toolkit is particularly helpful for students and early-career professionals in fields like **Software Engineering**, **DevOps**, and **Cybersecurity**.
